	Graphics programming is a niche that I have always been curious about.
There were attempts in the past but I did not have the patience to learn how to
import the libraries needed and other Visual Studio depencency nonsense. C++ is 
not a language that I am overly familiar with and I am accustomed to more of a 
Java experience. 

I am following along with the PDF provided by this website:
https://learnopengl.com/

**Warning**
The project files here are currently incomplete since I have linked the required 
libraries for glfw from elsewhere. I do not know if that is typical, as I am new 
to the concept of managing dependencies at this time. I still remember vividly 
during my first job as a developer how difficult it was for my director to setup 
our project files.
