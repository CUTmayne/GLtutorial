	Graphics programming is a niche that I have always been curious about.
There were attempts in the past but I did not have the patience to learn how to
import the libraries needed and other Visual Studio depencency nonsense. C++ is 
not a language that I am overly familiar with and I am accustomed to more of a 
Java experience. ....
